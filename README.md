# Flight Delay: Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) of flight delays in the USA from 2008 to 2023, encompassing a massive dataset of 30 million rows, has provided valuable insights into the complexities of air travel punctuality. This analysis was conducted using various Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

The analysis began by examining departure delay, shedding light on its distribution and variations throughout different times of the day, years, carriers, and origin airports. This initial exploration revealed patterns and trends in departure delays that set the stage for a deeper investigation.

Arrival delay was the next focus of the EDA, with an examination of its distribution, correlation with other variables, and relationships with departure delays. The analysis further delved into the impact of scheduled departure and arrival times on arrival delays, revealing critical insights into how flight schedules affect punctuality over time and across months.

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of arrival delay, the components contributing to this metric were dissected. Utilizing correlation matrices and pair plots, the relationships between these components were unveiled, elucidating how various factors interact and influence one another.

In addition to departure and arrival delay analysis, this EDA probed the intricacies of Carrier and NAS (National Airspace System) delays, uncovering essential details about the contributing factors and their effects on overall flight punctuality.
